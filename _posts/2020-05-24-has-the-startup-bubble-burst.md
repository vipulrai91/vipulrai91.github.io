# 2020 touted as the most difficult years for startup? Has the bubble burst?<br>

## Here are my views

### Note : **This is solely my understanding of how things are going wrong and does not intend to undermine the actions taken by the companies**

_This year started on very bad note with the whole world going through pandemic and no one knows till when this will continue<br>
People have been struggling to make their ends meet , risking their lives so that they can have bread at the table for themselves and their loved ones_

Lot of companies have their business at standstill with 90% losses to almost no revenue.

## Travel and hospitality sectors being one of the most affected

With litertally no business, no revenues and the cost of real estate , mortagages mounting , I feel for them.

Even if everything returns to business as usual it is a long road ahead filled with uncertanities , only time will tell how many of them would survive or bite the dust.

There are exceptions though(without naming the company) - firing employees , winding their premier labs - still spending $7 billion to aquire a competitor.<br>
Does this ring a bell?

There is something natively wrong here.

## But What About Online Food Delivery Platforms?

Food delivery platforms were one of the few operating during the lockdown as it is essential services.

With people stranded at home , and work from home pressure mounting as employeers take advantage of employees fear of losing the job , the sales and revenues was expected to sour higher.

Also the hefty discounts given before Covid-19 turned to additional delivery, packaging,restaurants charges with amounted to delivery charges being almost 30-40% sometimes more than 60% of the actual cost.

But still we ordered.Because why not!

And still these companies are in crisis?

This is the statement from one of the food delivery platforms's founder and I quote "_It will initiate company-wide temporary pay cuts as it tries to preserve cash in an uncertain business environment_"

### There are many other examples but I will not talk more on this.

My point is to understand the driving thought behind these mass layoffs.<br>
Here is what I feel.

## Covid-19 as an excuse to break even

Most of us know that none of the unicorn companies or the blue eyed boys **were never in profits.**

They were sitting on huge cash pile burning the money which investor had showered upon them ,trying to either kill the competitor or acquire them until one of them give's in or goes out of the business.

Now with investor's being aggresive to get back their returns and becoming relentless these companies are finally trying to break even.

The cost? Beloved employees are the scapegoat.

## Covid-19 as an excuse to get marketing and sales people out

Now that most of the companies have become household names , companies having no more coupons to offer , strategy changing from expansion to retaining the customers. The need for marketing and sales obviously becomes less.<br>
This is a great oppprtunity to get rid of these people Because why not?

## The bench had grown

The trend started by Services companies made a way into the startup's as well. Always having additional resource (bad term to use , I prefer people but who cares !) at disposal.<br>
Who would want additional person working when we can torture the hell out of existing employee(Jobs are hard to find!)

### There are many more reasons which soon all of us would see in days to come , would keep updating.

There are exceptions though and I would name them : Airbnb has shown class [read here](https://news.airbnb.com/a-message-from-co-founder-and-ceo-brian-chesky/) in how they handled this. This was expected from others as well but sadly..<br>
